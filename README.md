# Habitracker

A basic daily habit tracker.

## Description

A user can set up habits they'd like to track (as either a check yes/no type or quantity). Each day, a new daily record is generated, and the user can then mark a habit complete or enter the quantity completed. That record will then get displayed among previous days' records to give users an overall visual of how often each habit is completed and be able to see how days compare to eachother. The app also keeps track of how many days in a row the user has completed each individual habit.

The purpose of the habit tracker is to provide users that have trouble remembering to complete daily habits a reminder, or a little more accountability and motivation to do the things they want to do each day, therefore eventually creating lasting habits.
